# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name
**Benja ‚Äî The Web Browser for Those Who Read**

## Vision Statement
Benja is a mobile web browser that transforms how people read on the internet. It‚Äôs designed for thoughtful, focused readers who consume articles, newsletters, and short books on the go. In a world cluttered with distractions and clickbait, Benja offers a calm, purposeful experience tailored to knowledge seekers.

## Problem Statement
Current mobile browsers are optimized for general web consumption ‚Äî fast searches, social media, and e-commerce. They fail readers in several key ways:
- They don‚Äôt remember where you left off in long articles.
- They offer no built-in ‚Äúreading mode‚Äù for clutter-free content.
- There is no audio experience that feels natural for articles.
- Users can‚Äôt easily summarize or organize what they read.
- Browsers don‚Äôt support content curation across sources (e.g., creating your own daily ‚Äúnewspaper‚Äù).

## Target Audience
- Knowledge workers and students who read news and essays daily.
- Busy professionals who want to consume content while commuting.
- Neurodivergent users who prefer structured, distraction-free reading experiences.
- People seeking alternatives to algorithmic news feeds and infinite scroll apps.

## Value Proposition
Benja helps readers **consume, organize, and retain** web-based content in a way that‚Äôs personalized, clutter-free, and optionally voice-enabled ‚Äî all while preserving user privacy and working offline when needed.

## Appendix

**Name Origin**  
"Benja" comes from the idea of a quiet, wise helper ‚Äî possibly an owl ‚Äî that aids your reading. The name evokes simplicity and trust.

**Competitor Analysis**
- Safari Reader Mode: good UX, but lacks memory and voice support.
- Pocket: content saver, not a full browser.
- Matter: reading-focused, but subscription-based and not privacy-first.
