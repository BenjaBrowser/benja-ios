# Benja — The Web Browser for Those Who Read 📖🦉

Benja is a minimalist, privacy-first web browser built with SwiftUI — designed for readers. Whether you're into essays, articles, newsletters, or short books, Benja helps you focus, save your progress, listen on the go, and retain what you read.

## ✨ Features

- **Smart Bookmarks** — Save any web page and resume exactly where you left off.
- **Read Mode** — A clean, clutter-free reading experience with just text and images.
- **Voiceover** — Listen to articles with natural-sounding text-to-speech.
- **Instant Summaries** — One-tap summaries generated on-device via local LLM.
- **Reading Dashboards** — Organize your own “reading spaces” by topic or mood.
- **Offline Support** — Preload content and use voice/summaries without internet.

## 🔒 Privacy by Design

Benja stores everything **locally on your device**. No tracking, no analytics, no cloud accounts required. Summaries and voice features use **on-device** models when available.
